RayTracer
=========

A RayTracer implementation from my Uni coursework. 

I intend to add more features to this as and when I have the time and inclination to experiment.

### Features

* Primitive Geometry
  * Planes
  * Triangles
  * Spheres
  * Circles
  
* Materials
  * Lambert
  * Phong
  * Specular
  * Perfect Reflective
  * Textures

### Features to do

* Scene definitions from a file
* Constructive Solid Geometry
* Support for Obj or PLY files
* Bump mapping
* Displacement mapping

### Contributions

Whilst I am not actively seeking contributions, if you fancy implementing anything from the TODO list, or even something completely different, just submit a pull request and I'll probably merge it in.
